## Module 9, Part 2: ML pipelines in TensorFlow Extended

This part of Module 9 gives an introduction to modern machine learning pipelines. Through a set of six notebooks, we'll interactively step through the construction of an ML pipeline in TensorFlow Extended.

Through these notebooks and the accompanying lectures, you will be exposed to some of the common components in industry-level ML pipelines. 

> You can find a much more comprehensive coverage in the TensorFlow Extended guide: https://www.tensorflow.org/tfx/guide. It's highly recommended to consult this as you go through the notebooks in this tutorial.
