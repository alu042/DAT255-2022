# Introduction

The goal of this short module is to illustrate some of the breadth of possibilities in deep learning. There are lots of ways to use deep neural networks to great effect, beyond what we've spent most of our time on in the course so far. 

The notebooks of this module illustrates how a change of _representation_ of your data can open the door to alternative approaches to construct predictive models, and how the fact that neural networks are _representation learners_ can be exploited to extract task-specific representations of data.
